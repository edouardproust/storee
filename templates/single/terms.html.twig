    <p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Any legal action of whatever nature brought by either you or us (collectively, the “Parties” and individually, a “Party”) shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in<span style="color: #8351f9;"> [name of county]</span> County, <span style="color: #8351f9;">[name of state]</span>, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.</p>

    <p><strong>Option 2: Informal Negotiations</strong></p>
    <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least <span style="color: #8351f9;">______</span> days before initiating arbitration.

    <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in <span style="color: #8351f9;">[name of county]</span> County, <span style="color: #8351f9;">[name of state]</span>, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.</p>
